		<p>You are probably wondering. Wait? Why is Marshadow on here? Great question. Marshadow has his own niche set that in my opinions works way better than any other set maybe not consistant but can turn around the pace of the match which is the thing marshadow is best at. Marshadow is my favorite pokemon to stop stat stacking mons. Sadly, the only counter to this kit is any speed boost above 1.5 and any stat boost that is 1.5 and has a higher speed stat than 383. Marshadow can learn reversal and endure in the same kit. With reversal he can oneshot any pokemon that does not resist fighting or he still can depending on their defensive stats. He checks all Calyrex picks really well as he can just oneshot all of them. With Marshadow's base stats it also does not hurt to go drain punch suprisingly but I would prefer shadowsneak to instantly eliminate Calyrex-Shadow. There is not too much to say but will also throw out you can oneshot groudon and kyogre with reversal marshadow (if they are not HP+Def maxed EVs). You can use endure to block moves may not be as efficient as protect but you can always get down to 1(or less than 4.2%) HP if you need max reversal damage which it's output would return 200. in gen 8 this kit was at it's strongest as marshadow could just steal after post dynamax or dynamax himself to give himself his own attack stats and endure can survive even dynamax attacks unlike protect.</p>
