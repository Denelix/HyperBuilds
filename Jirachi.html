	<div class="text">
		<p>Great to use in National Dex Ubers. High counters cheese Primal-Groudon users with Tera type flying. With U turn you can switch out effectively with wish especially if you are slower. All EVs are put into bulk to survive groudon and rayquayza. Thunder wave can stop a rayquaza from doing anything as he will be outsped by your whole team unless he uses dragon dance. If you have a foulplay pokemon on the side you can tank a hit using uturn and switch to a foulplay pokemon like umbreon with high enough speed EVs to outspeed paralyzed rayquaza. Jirachi's steel typing assists very well on switches and the psychic typing is good for standing up against Koraidon and his high attack stat. Preferably vs Koraidon is either scarfed or life orbed. They should not tera fire vs a jirachi instead they will set up a swords dance a perfect time to thunderwave or body slam and u turn into a counter the Attack boosted Koraidon like Toxapex, Umbreon or any unaware switch to ignore the stats or lastly a marshadow to steal the stats for free and sweep from there on. Kyogre is a no go when going jirachi and same for any weakness special sweeper. Physical defensive Jirachi is stronger as it will still be tanked by special attackers. If kyogre is a huge fear or any other special sweeper consider a special defensive and/or a groudon/quagsire. If needed to stay in you can always iron head to paraflinch your target and heal from leftovers. Or if you need to take down an Xerneas than kindly iron head should 2HKO no worries about fainting to it since it's fairy typing is not very effective agianst you. so along with other fairy types like zacian which jirachi should defeat with ease with any type of paralyze. Reason why Body slam and Thunderwave are swappable are so you can consider paralyzing ground sweepers like arceus ground or groudon if jirachi cannot do much in time.</p>
