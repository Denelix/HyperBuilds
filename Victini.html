		<p>Smogon Written by Ryuji: Victini possesses a unique niche due to its good bulk and typing, allowing it to check Tapu Lele, Mega Medicham, and soft check Iron Valiant. It also possesses a decent offensive presence, thanks to its strong STAB in V-create. However, relying on Heavy-Duty Boots means it will lack wallbreaking power and longevity to check Pokemon long-term. Bolt Strike hits Water-types such as Toxapex, Tapu Fini, and Urshifu-R. U-turn lets it grab momentum from the likes of Landorus-T, Great Tusk, and Garchomp, bringing in partners who handle them like Dragapult and Weavile. Encore lets it cripple Pokemon like Volcarona and Mega Latias by locking them into Quiver Dance and Calm Mind respectively. It can also lock Pokemon into a recovery move, like Toxapex with Recover. Toxic cripples switch-ins like Gastrodon, Dragonite, and Garchomp. Tera Fire propels Victini's V-create to absurd levels of power, allowing it to function as somewhat of a wallbreaker. However, becoming a Fire-type can be troublesome for Victini, as it's still susceptible to Pursuit trapping and loses all of its defensive capabilities. Victini works best on bulky offense teams that appreciate its defensive and offensive role compression. Strong-but-frail wallbreakers like Weavile, Dragapult, Urshifu-R, and Kartana all appreciate Victini's ability to bring them safely onto the field with U-turn. Fighting-types like the aforementioned Urshifu-R and Zamazenta can pressure Dark-types like Weavile and Mega Tyranitar that Victini struggles against. Victini appreciates Pokemon that have good defensive synergy with it such as Water-resistant Pokemon like Ferrothorn and Rotom-W. They also appreciate Victini's ability to pivot into Fire- and Grass-type attacks while they can sponge Water-type moves for Victini. On a similar note, Landorus-T and Gliscor can both switch into Ground-type attacks from the likes of Garchomp and Great Tusk for Victini. In return, Victini can stomach Ice-types moves from Kyurem.</p>
