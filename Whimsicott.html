	<div class="text">
		<p>No one uses Whimsicott. But it's a poikemon that can stop both walls and sweepers using the prankster ability or Infiltrator. With Whimsicott's Medium high speed stat it can take down plenty of AG baton pass builds with an early leech seed. You can even set up a subsitute yourself and with your low HP stat you can heal off your opponents to keep your subsitute up. In ubers prankster is way more recommended as you should take moonblast as an attacking move to fight off dark types. You can encore weak moves done against you or status moves attempted against you so you can force a switch or you can switch to a pokemon that counters the move they are encored so you can have a free setup. Whimsicott can acutally solo beat an entire team without hitting a move using this annoying playstyle especially if put with a shadowtag pokemon like goth or mega-gengar. Tera Fairy is recommended since the grass typing is not that useful unless you are playing OU+ where there are less poison threats maybe you could resist water moves since grass resists a decent amount of typings.</p>
