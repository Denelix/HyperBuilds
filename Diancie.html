		<p>Mega Diancie. Probably the best scaling carry in showdown. but cant be because Zacian and other steel moves can oneshot Mega Diancie even if you got x4 Defense. But if there are no more steel types Mega Diancie sweeps with full HP if you are using Draining kiss every single match you win. With magic bounce can delay or reflect sticky webs or stealth rocks. Sadly, in ubers the most common stealth rock setup is Necrozma(the quadrupedal one) is your biggest counter unless you have x2 calm mind with earthpower if chosen. The reason why I gave an option for baton pass instead of earthpower is so you can start off diancie against any one with 349 speed or less so you can mega evolve then baton pass out. Or if you have a good amoutn of stat boosts you can swap to another sweeper and hand them your stats. baton pass grants alot of utility for Diancie and for your team. A great dragon counter and ho oh counter. Draining kiss on diancie over moonblast so if you were to tank a hit and oneshot your opponent with your calmmind stacks you should heal to pretty much full HP because your HP stat is so low and your defense stats are one of the highest combined defense stats in the game unrivaled to shuckle of course. Even with -10% attack from your nature you can easily onetap most x4 rock weaknesses and with the 40% chance of +2Defense boost there is no risk of using Diamond Storm. Once you have x2 Defense you can take regular damage from Earthquakes and even compete against groudon (if you have earthpower)and arceus ground EASILY! Once diancie has her stats there is no way of defeating her probably also one of the safest carries in the game. Dont match dracovish unless you are x4 Defense</p>
