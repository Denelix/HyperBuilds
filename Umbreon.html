	<div class="text">
		<p>Umbreon is one of the strongest Special Defensive tanks in the game dispite being avaliable to pick in UU. I have been using Umbreon in AG ever since AG was released and is still a stable pick in Gen 9 AG though tera is not so useful on Umbreon. Umbreon can be a great switch for covering a toxapex or countering Calyrex-Shadow as dark resists both psychic and ghost and to overkill with max special defense you can solo 1v1 or predict a switch using wish, foulplay, or toxic. Foulplay can check for physical mons. Spaming foulplay on a special attacker as a special defensive Dark tank can be crusial for opponents to switch. If your opponent were to switch to zacian-sword, rayquaza, Blaziken, or Palfin you should tank a good chunk of health from any non sustainable carry. Suprisingly dispite being a special defensive wall Umbreon is also capable of cleaning up the rest of a team if can sustain hits that deal 40%~ of it's health using leftovers. When using umbreon it is very well parred up with a toxapex to prevent yourself from being poisoned or when taking a dark super effective move you can always check what move they are about to run if you are sure you are against a non-setup by using protect then swapping or staying depending on how high elo you are. If you are lacking that consider using fairy or poison terra. Fairy is my preference since ground moves are very strong in ubers and you want to have as low ground weaknesses possible. Umbreon is slowly starting to be used as a pick recently and is no longer as niche as it used to be apperently using the same set I used to climb to top 10-20 AG ladder and 1500~ in UU ladder in Gen 6-7. A mon you should really be careful against is blissey when playing umbreon. Foulplay is useless vs blissey due to her low base attack stat (10Attack) and seismic toss blissey alone will win everytime. If a blissey is switched into you consider switching immediately or wish switching if you have heal bell on your moveset. Also small speed increase to outspeed the speedties if there are any speed ties you are worried about just lower Sp.D for speed but 8 or 12 should be enough. The physical set isnt that competitive but it uses the same moveset if you would like to use it like against a groudon but most physical mons in ubers may have a fighting move or play rough.</p>
